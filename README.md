  <p><em><b>Meeting Analyzer Interface</b></em></p>
</div>



## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"File not found" errors**: Ensure all required files are in the project root
2. **Authentication errors**: Check that `credentials.json` is properly configured
3. **API quota exceeded**: Monitor your Google API usage in the Cloud Console
4. **Transcription failures**: If nothing was spoken during meet, audio too low or extremely poor audio quality


### Gmail Authentication Issues

- **Refresh token expired**: Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate
- **Scope errors**: Ensure the Gmail API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- **Permission denied**: Check that your app is not in testing mode restrictions

### Meet Join and End Issues

#### üö™ Zoom Meeting Join Failures

- **Issue:** The bot may occasionally fail to join Zoom meetings due to browser popup sequence variations.
- **Root Cause:** Chrome's popup order can vary between sessions, affecting the automated joining process.
- **Workaround:** If you encounter joining issues, modify the popup handling logic in the `join_zoom_and_record()` function in `zoom_bot.py` to match your browser's current popup sequence.

#### üîö Meeting End Detection Failures  
- **Issue:** The bot fails to properly detect meeting termination when the host leaves instead of ending the session.
- **Root Cause:** The application is designed to detect "meeting ended" signals, but when hosts simply leave the meeting (rather than formally ending it), this trigger is not activated.
- **Workaround:** Ensure meeting hosts use the "End Meeting" option rather than just leaving the session for proper bot functionality.



## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Credentials**: Never commit `credentials.json`, `token.json`, or `.env` files
- **Video Data**: Personal video (`me.mp4`) stays local and is not uploaded
- **Meeting Data**: All meeting logs are stored locally by default
- **API Keys**: Store securely in environment variables
- **Network**: Use HTTPS for all external API calls
